# Annotated Cairo Contract Template  

This repository provides an **example annotated smart contract** written in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/). It is designed as a reference and starting point for users exploring StarkNet contract development.  

## Features  

- **Annotated contract:** Includes detailed comments explaining the code structure and logic.  
- **Deployment and initialization scripts:** The `scripts/` directory contains scripts for deploying the contract and initializing the storage using [`starkli`](https://book.starkli.rs/).  We'll upload scripts using sncast soon.
